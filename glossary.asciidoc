- *Anycast*: Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology in which datagrams from a single sender are routed to the topologically nearest node in a group of potential receivers, though it may be sent to several nodes, all identified by the same destination address <<ref:anycast>>.

- *AP*: In computer networking, a wireless access point (AP) is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi, or related standards. The AP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a standalone device, but it can also be an integral component of the router itself. An AP is differentiated from a hotspot, which is the physical space where the wireless service is provided.

- *AS*: Within the Internet, an autonomous system (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the Internet.

- *ASN*: An autonomous system number (ASN) is a unique number to identify an autonomous system (AS) and which enables that system to exchange exterior routing information with other neighboring autonomous systems.

- *CIDR*: TODO

- *BGP*: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.

- *BIRD*: BIRD Internet Routing Daemon is a network routing software providing implementations of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and others routing protocols.

- *Community Network*: A community network is a computer-based system that is intended to help support geographical communities by supporting, augmenting, and extending already existing social networks.

- *Drupal*: Drupal is a free and open-source web content-management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License.

- *eBGP*: Short for External Border Gateway Protocol, eBGP is the protocol used to transport information to other BGP enabled systems in different autonomous systems (AS).

- *Ethernet*: TODO

- *Firmware*: Firmware is a type of software that usually control low-level components of the device it is usually held in ROM. While this is the general accepted meaning of the term, in the context of embedded routing and in community networks it is common practice to call firmware the software running on the routers, while it is usually flashed like a proper firmware it is really a software providing a full operative system and higher levels tools such as web interface or command line interface.

- *IP*: The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables inter-networking, and essentially establishes the Internet.

- *Last mile*: Last mile is the common colloquialism referring to that portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the end-user <<ref:lastmile>>.

- *LiMe*: Common abbreviation for Libre-Mesh.

- *Ln*: Abbreviation of layer n, it refers to Internet layers, as an example L2 refer to Ethernet the layer 2 of internet stack.

- *MAC address*: TODO

- *OpenWrt*: OpenWrt is an operating system based on the Linux kernel, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic. All components OpenWrt ships are optimized for size, to be small enough for fitting into the limited storage and memory available in home routers.

- *Quagga*: Quagga is a network routing software suite providing implementations of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and IS-IS for Unix-like platforms.

- *Router*: Routers are devices which forward packets between interconnected networks in order to allow hosts not connected directly to the same local area network to communicate with each other.

- *Routing Daemon*: A Routing Daemon is in UNIX terminology a non-interactive program running on background which does the dynamic part of Internet routing, that is it communicates with the other routers, calculates routing tables and sends them to the OS kernel which does the actual packet forwarding.

- *SSID*: TODO

- *TTL*: Time to live TODO

- *UML*: The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering, which is designed to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

- *Unicast*: In computer networking, unicast transmission is the sending of messages to a single network destination identified by a unique address <<ref:unicast>>.

- *WDS*: A wireless distribution system (WDS) is a system enabling the wireless interconnection of access points in an IEEE 802.11 network. It allows a wireless network to be expanded using multiple access points without the traditional requirement for a wired backbone to link them. The notable advantage of WDS over other solutions is it preserves the MAC addresses of client frames across links between access points.

- *WiFi*: WiFi is a local area wireless computer networking technology that allows electronic devices to network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands.
