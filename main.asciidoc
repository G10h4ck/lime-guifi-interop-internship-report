//== Introduction

The biggest community network in the world is Guifi.net <<ref:cnw>> it spreads across Catalonia and beyond. IP routing on a such big community network is not a trivial task, in addition to the big size, the decentralized nature of our network encourage choice, so usually different parts of our networks uses different routing protocols. +
In order to make those routing protocols interoperate is now mostly a manual job, various groups have developed several OpenWrt based solutions to ease networking equipment configuration, but seamless protocol interoperability is an open problem, moreover we work mostly with low cost embedded device, so little performance footprint is always a requirement. +
The scope of this work is to investigate mainly used routing protocols in particular BGP, BMX6 and BATMAN-adv, to study past interoperability experiments and to extend Libre-Mesh and possibly implementing seamless interoperability between it and Guifi.net. +
The new feature must be usable and stable so at the end of the project we can deploy it in our production setups such as Barcelona Botanical Garden, our offices in Aureasocial and others clients. +
Testing of the new features in real environment and protocols parameters adjusting for the optimal functioning is part of this work too.

== State of the art

=== BGP
BGP (acronym of Border Gateway Protocol) is a standard routing protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator that is involved in making core routing decisions, because it needs information of each route reachability path to make decisions BGP is usually classified as a path vector protocol. Version 4 of BGP has been in use on the Internet since 1994, it's mayor improvement in respect to older version that are obsolete and unused on the Internet is the support for classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) and routes aggregation. +
BGP may be used for routing within an AS. In this application it is referred to as Internal BGP, or iBGP. In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol may be referred to as Exterior Border Gateway Protocol, External BGP, or eBGP. +
As BGP doesn't perform any type of neighbor discovery, peers are established by manual configuration. For each peer router a connection through TCP port 179 must be established, after the connection is established BGP daemons synchronize with peers by sending the whole routing information they have to peers, after this initial sync only updates are transmitted to peers.

=== Guifi.net
Our networks uses different routing protocols such as BGP, OSPF, OLSR, BMX6, BATMAN-adv, Babel and more.
Over time lot of Guifi.net nodes have been build sticking to the older but well known solution named _<<modelohibrido, {MdHd}>>_.
This solution imply lot of manual work and a central provisioning server that know all details about the Guifi.net network, de facto limiting the resilience,  the scalability and the growth of Guifi.net. To overcome _{MdHd}_ limitations lot of efforts developing new solutions have existed most of them based on mesh technology but none of them, mainly because of resource lack and consequent missing long term support, have been widely adopted causing even more fragmentation and making more difficult interoperability. Aside from this context <<libre-mesh, Libre-Mesh>> has been bred independently but with the joint forces of multiples community networks seems a long term viable solution and offer already lot of advantages in respect to the other explored paths.

[[modelohibrido]]
==== {MdHd}
As of _{MdHd}_ community network nodes can belong to two categories: _{SpNd}s_ and _{Nd}s_, in this model _{Nd}s_ are not really nodes of the network as they do not do routing for other nodes of Guifi.net and just attach to a _{SpNd}s_, while _{SpNd}s_ do route <<ref:mdhdspnd>>. In _{SpNd}s_ usually a _Mikrotik routerboard_ is used as router while externals WiFi AP are configured as plain WDS bridge <<ref:mdhd>>, if two _{SpNd}s_ are connected by a WiFi link the router of each node see the router of the other node as if it was directly connected with an Ethernet cable. On top of the routers of each node BGP routing protocol is running, on each node connected BGP peering have to be established, each _{SpNd}_ has his own unique private ASN assigned by the Guifi.net Drupal based network map, in this setup each _{SpNd}_ of Guifi.net act as an AS with typical eBGP information exchange mode. +
While BPG seems the more appropriate routing protocol for a neutral internet exchange point, wireless community networks have completely different needs that BGP cannot satisfy such as chosing WiFi path with more bandwidth availabe or automatic link establishment. _{MdHd}_ has helped Guifi.net to grow but over time new technology better suited for wireless community have emerged exposing many limitations of this model.

=== Bird
It's a routing daemon implementing various protocols in particular BGP.

=== BMX6
BMX6 is an open-source, mesh routing protocol, developed by Axel Neumann. It originated as an independent branch of the BATMAN routing protocol and is already used successfully in mesh networks <<ref:bmxan>>. Being a mesh routing protocol, BMX6 distributes node descriptions which can contain node-specific configurations. It optimizes the communication between neighboring nodes for minimal protocol overhead.

.BMX6 is
Pro-active::
	Even if there is no traffic in the network, the routes to all the network nodes are known pro-actively.

Distance-vector::
	Nodes does not have a global view of the network topology, the next-hop to a destination is computed based on aggregated information.

Table-driven::
	Each node hold a table that maps each destination node to the next hop and the cost it will take to get there.


=== Batman-adv
B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced (often referenced as batman-adv) is an implementation of the B.A.T.M.A.N. routing protocol in form of a Linux kernel module operating on layer 2.

=== qMp
qMp do facilitate the creation of roaming enabled mesh networks, it is based on OpenWrt and BMX6 <<ref:qmp>>, qMp already supports configuration provisioning by guifi.net map _unsolclick_ <<ref:missing>> for mesh parameters adjusting but it leave the interoperability with <<modelohibrido, {MdHd}>> mostly to manual static configuration done by the user <<ref:qmpmdhd>> or in rare cases to manually configured Quagga-BMX6 module that is unreliable, resource intensive and requires manual configuration. Moreover qMp is designed around BMX6, in a way that to add support for another routing protocol would imply a big refactoring of qMp code.

[[libre-mesh]]
=== Libre-Mesh
Libre-Mesh (often referenced as LiMe) is an initiative undertaken by community networks members of several continents that collaborate towards a common goal: to develop a set of tools that facilitate the deployment of Free Networks for any community in the world. +
Main tool is LiMe meta-firmware: based on OpenWrt, eases the creation of community networks, and enables existing communities to add roaming enabled network clouds to their networks. +
To accomplish his goal LiMe meta-firmware have an highly modular design and implementation, the core of LiMe meta-firmware is the lime-system package.

==== Network Architecture
TODO

==== Software Architecture
LiMe meta-firmware is structured as a set of OpenWrt packages, it provides a command line tool `lime-config` that when invoked simply delegate the work of updating the configurations to installed LiMe modules by calling their `clean()` and `configure()` methods, LiMe minimal installation already ships necessary modules but the architecture is meant to be extensible so more modules can be added if needed. LiMe modules are often modular themselves, an UML scheme may help the comprehension of LiMe architecture as a whole:

image::images/lime-system_UML.png[align="center"]

===== Hardware Detection
Hardware detection module is in charge of detecting hardware components of the router and if some of them need a special configuration in order to work according to LiMe needs generate that configuration, to accomplish its task it is modular itself and for each hardware detection plug-in installed ( such as `lime-hwd-usbradio` ) it execute the respective `clean` method that is supposed to cleanup outdated configuration and the `detect_hardware` method that is supposed to configure the hardware and can put specific `config` sections in `/etc/config/lime` to be read by others lime components if necessary.

===== Wireless
Wireless module is supposed to detect WiFi interfaces and prepare them for usage with LiMe, to accomplish that task it reads and write to `/etc/config/lime` and `/etc/config/wireless`, as depicted in the UML schema it is modular itself and delegate part of the works to his submodules called `mode`.

===== Network
Network module is in charge of configuring network interfaces and routing protocols, it is a big task to accomplish in a nifty way to do it is modular too. It offers a tight API to his modules that are called `proto` (such as `lime-proto-bgp`) while they must expose to network module a statefull interface that consists of:

- `configured` flag, it is false by default and setted to true when the `proto` is configured.
- `configure(args)` this method is in charge of configuring the underlying routing protocol, args is an array containing all parameters found in configuration file, parameters have positional meaning.
- `setup_interface(ifname, args)` this function is called once per each networking interface found on the router `ifname` is the linux name of the interface and `args` is an array containing all related parameters found in configuration file.
- `apply()` usually just restart the underlying routing protocol to make the new configurations effective.

===== Firewall
Configure OpenWrt firewall if installed or iptables according to Libre-Mesh needs.

===== System
Configure other miscellaneous stuff that do not fit well in other modules.

===== Hardware detector ground routing

===== Hardware detector USB radio

===== Protocol adhoc
TODO

===== Protocol anygw

This protocol is shipped as an optional package `lime-proto-anygw`, but is installed and enabled by the default in LiMe distribution.

image::images/lime-proto-anygw_UML.png[align="center"]

The anygw LiMe protocol is a light implementation of anycast gateway, it builds the virtual Ethernet interface `anygw` on top of <<proto:lan, Lan protocol>> clients access interface `br-lan` using the Linux kernel module `macvlan` <<ref:macvlan>>. When any-cast gateway is enabled the first address of the mesh network subnet is reserved for any-cast gateway operation, together with the IP also a crafted locally administered but valid *unicast* <<ref:macaddress>> MAC address is used, all any-cast gateways on a LiMe L2 cloud share the same IP and MAC address, so when a client sends a packets directed outside it's cloud it gets routed at L3 by the nearest router.

[[proto:lan]]
===== Protocol lan
The lan LiMe protocol is meant to configure the network local to the node, in the default configuration it is also in charge of giving access to the mesh network at layer 2 to clients next to the node. It configure the node main IPv4 and IPv6 and bridge all network interface meant to give access to clients like wireless AP interfaces and Ethernet interfaces.

=== lime-system

image::images/lime-system_devel_UML.png[align="center"]

Highlighted in green the parts modified in the scope of the internship.

As it works on layer 2 it doesn't need much interaction with BGP to announce the mesh subnet route, announcing the route for subnet used by batman-adv mesh cloud as been achieved implementing `bgp_conf(...)` directly into `lime.proto.lan` without modifying any code related to batman-adv.

[source, lua]
------------------------------------------------------------
function lan.bgp_conf(templateVarsIPv4, templateVarsIPv6)
	local base_conf = [[
protocol direct {
	interface "br-lan";
}
]]
	return base_conf
end
------------------------------------------------------------

=== lime-proto-anygw
TODO code too

=== lime-proto-bgp
To accomplish the task of interoperability between Libre-Mesh networks and Guifi.net BGP infrastructure, I had to create a new `proto` for libre-mesh called `lime-proto-bgp`, it is in charge of configuring the LiMe system so it is capable of BGP routing, as back-end it uses BIRD.
While the module is in charge of configuring BGP routing it delegate through the LiMe modularization pattern to the others `proto` the specific configuration needed to make possible to automatize the interoperation between the specific `proto` and BGP, to accomplish that a new callback has been added to the standard `proto` API:

- `proto.bgp_conf(templateVarsIPv4, templateVarsIPv6)` it is called by the `proto` BGP for each `proto` the user has requested to exchange routes with, this function take as parameters two tables that are both readable to read already defined template variable and writable to eventually define additional template variables to pass back to `proto` BGP and returns a template snippet that is appended to the bird configuration file by `proto` BGP.

==== Exporting BGP routes to a kernel table

[source,bash]
--------------------------------------
table tobmx;

protocol pipe {
	table master;
	peer table tobmx;
	import all;
	export filter {
		if source = RTS_BGP then accept;
		else reject;
        };
}

protocol kernel
{
	scan time 20;
	table tobmx;
	kernel table 200;
	import all;
	export all;
}
--------------------------------------

==== Importing mesh routes with low preference
Guifi.net BGP routers are form different vendors and often they have different implementation on which route attributes are considered when deciding which path to prefer, after reading documentations from different vendors, seems to me that in eBGP setups (like Guifi.net) the most reliable way to share a route with low preference is to artificially enlarge it's AS path, this technique is called AS-path-prepending and it's common in situation where someone want to share a route but want others routers prefer other paths if there is some path available.

=== Interoperability use-cases
Due to LiMe modular nature this development has many possible application that spread out of boundaries of this internship, in the following sections a brief analysis of more common use-cases on which the development has been focused is exposed.

[[meshdistribution]]
==== Mesh network as distribution
In this scenario a BGP backbone is used as transport network while the mesh network is used as ``last mile'' distribution.

image::images/simple_exchange_topology.png[align="center"]

Legend::
- Black routers: routers running LiMe with pure mesh setup.
- Red routers: Guifi.net routers configured as of _{MdHd}_.
- Blue straight lines: Cabled mesh links.
- Blue curvy dashed lines: WiFi mesh links.
- Yellow straight lines: Guifi.net links as of _{MdHd}_.

This use case is someway workable also with the pasts solution but with strong drawbacks:

- Instead of the ``red and black'' router we would need two devices one of the ``red type'' let's call it +R+ and one of the ``black type'' lets call it +B+ connected, this mean a frontier node cost the double on average.
- The +B+ router would announce statically the whole 10.0.0.0/8 to the mesh network and have +R+ as gateway for the entire 10.0.0.0/8 net, this causes packets generated into the mesh directed to nonexistent hosts in that range will flow all across the mesh and even get into the BGP backbone, effectively reducing bandwidth available for legitimate packets.
- In the +R+ router all the subnets used by the mesh network must be statically routed to +B+ router and then written into the BGP daemon configuration to be announced to the rest of the ``red network'', so each time a subnet is added to the the mesh network the +R+ router need to be reconfigured manually, consuming time of some skilled Guifi.net operator.

All those limitations are solved using the software developed during this internship, moreover other more complex and even more common interoperability scenarios gets solved.

==== Mesh network with multiple exchanges
*TODO: Needs further analysis + control flow schema* +
This scenario is very common in high population density zones, small neighborhood community mesh network grow beyond the district boundaries gaining geographical proximity to multiple backbone nodes, as the number of user usually grow too as the network expand having just an exchange point become a bottleneck, in this case having multiple exchange point can improve the access bandwidth to upstream networks.

image::images/multiple_exchanges_topology.png[align="center"]

This scenario in not practically manageable with past technology, and the more exchange point are added the trickier it gets to have a working stable configuration, while with the development done during this internship after BGP peering setup everything works out of the box.

==== Mesh network as transport
*TODO: Needs further analysis + control flow schema* +
The most important technical factor that slowed down LiMe adoption into Guifi.net is that the majority of preexistent network infrastructure is built following the _{MdHd}_ so when someone decide to extend Guifi.net infrastructure need to be compatible with _{MdHd}_, without the development done during this internship the only possible interoperability setup was having the mesh as a leaf <<meshdistribution, distribution network>>, while now it is possible to build Guifi.net backbone with LiMe being compatible both with mesh and BGP networks, it is even possible to use LiMe to fill the gap between isolated BGP network islands.

image::images/mesh_as_transport_topology.png[align="center"]

This will certain encourage LiMe adoption and maybe finally obsolete _{MdHd}_, giving the possibility to Guifi.net to jump into another phase of horizontal growth with less dependency from manual configuration work, skilled people will have time to work on more interesting and not repetitive configuration tasks, with consequent work quality improvement, costs reduction and increased network accessibility for the masses.

==== Route count limitation

BMX6 store distribute routes in a shared structure called ``node description'' for performance reasons the size of this structure is limited and it's not enough to contain the whole Guifi.net BGP routing table, a first approach to resolve this problem was to enable route aggregation in BMX6 ``redistTable'' plug-in, but despite the high CPU usage the size of the table was reduced only by half and that was not enough to fit inside a ``node description'', moreover the high CPU load caused timeouts in communication between BMX6 and Linux kernel causing BMX6 to crash. To solve this problem next BMX6 version node description will be structured like a linked list so the node description can contain a pointer to another structure if just one is not enough to store all the needed informations, the draw back is that this is not compatible with past versions of BMX6 but it doesn't represents a blocking problem because BMX6 users are used too incompatible changes between versions, this solution has been discussed at BattlemeshV8 and we will do further testing at our offices in Barcelona.

==== Reducing the performance footprint
Default BMX6 `redistTable` configurations are not suitable to our needs in fact they make the router sloppy and with 100% CPU load every-time, doing some analysis on what was happening I found some causes:

- By default `redistTable` do routes aggregation that is a CPU and memory intensive work.
- It reacts to every single change in the routing table recalculating all aggregations.
- Our routing table is big so calculating the ``aggregated'' version is a long work.
- Our average device have quite limited resources (300-600Mhz MIPS CPU, 32-128MB RAM)

To solve this problem I have disabled route aggregation while enabling routing table event aggregation, with event aggregation it should be even possible to enable route aggregation but further studying it's needed, and the behavior of loop avoidance in case aggregation is enabled need to be studied too.
