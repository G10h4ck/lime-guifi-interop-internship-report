An RFC is authored by engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or simply to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor. The IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFCs as Internet standards <<ref:wkpdrfc>>.

Today, most communication between computers is based on the Internet Protocol; therefore most network sockets are Internet sockets. A socket API is an application programming interface (API), usually provided by the operating system, that allows application programs to control and use network sockets. Internet socket APIs are usually based on the Berkeley sockets standard <<ref:wkpdsocket>>. 

- *SSID*: In computer networking, a service set is a set consisting of all the devices associated with a wireless LAN.

Generally in wireless networking terminology, a station, wireless client and node are often used interchangeably, with no strict distinction existing between these terms <<ref:wkpdsta>>.

- *Subnet* : A subnetwork, or subnet, is a logical, visible subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with a common, identical, most-significant bit-group in their IP address.

The rest field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface <<ref:wkpdsubnet>>.
